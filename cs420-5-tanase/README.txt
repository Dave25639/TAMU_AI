The plans that my program produces has four types of moves. I tried to make it work with just one action, but it wasn't able to work in conjunction with the arc logic which restricts movement between certain pegs. These four moves are as follows:

1: A move of a disk on top of a disk to the top of another disk.
2: A move of a disk on top of a disk to an empty peg.
3: A move of a disk at the bottom of a peg on top of another disk.
4: A move of a disk at the bottom of a peg to an empty peg.

The actions are labelled accordingly and will tell you the disk to be moved, the disk that was below it (if any), the disk that will be below it (if any), the source peg, and the destination peg.

This should be enough information to allow the grader to trace through the puzzle.
